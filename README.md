# AmazonClusterPrediction Using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering

The Dataset is based on Sample of Amazon.com's customer details, with with we want to predict the <b> Purchasing Power </b> of the Customer based on the data provided and divide them into diferent clusters which suits them the most so that the company can understand the purchasing Power of its customers and use the data to target ads and other campgains to sell more products 

## K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is a machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into K distinct clusters based on their features or attributes. The "K" in K-means refers to the number of clusters to be formed.
The algorithm works by iteratively partitioning the data points into K clusters, with each cluster represented by its centroid (the mean of all points in the cluster).
The centroids are then updated to the mean of all points assigned to the cluster, and the process is repeated until convergence, It aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid.

## Hierarchical clustering

Hierarchical clustering algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters.the algorithm creates a hierarchical tree-like structure of clusters, known as a dendrogram, based on the similarity between the data points.

There are two types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering starts with each data point as its own cluster and then iteratively merges the most similar clusters until all data points belong to a single cluster
