# AmazonClusterPrediction Using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering


## K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is a machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into K distinct clusters based on their features or attributes. The "K" in K-means refers to the number of clusters to be formed.
The algorithm works by iteratively partitioning the data points into K clusters, with each cluster represented by its centroid (the mean of all points in the cluster).
The centroids are then updated to the mean of all points assigned to the cluster, and the process is repeated until convergence, It aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid.
